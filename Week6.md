## Week 6: **Python_Koans**

<br>

## 🆁🅴🅵🅻🅴🅲🆃🅸🅾🅽:

The test of patience and the road to perseverance.  It's my initiative to dip in the water thinking that I will be taught the steps on how to manoeuvre the water but to my dismay, it wasn't.  I feel like I'm on my own yet I am surviving. I don't know how deep the water is, all I know is that I can still breathe, I am alive, and am ready to explore more.  Should I opt for the traditional way of learning to swim which may take years or enjoy the unconventional and still be skilful? 
After reflecting, I appreciated the test-driven development we're doing with the Python_koans.  It hones my observation skills and lets me use my creativity logically.  The course may be over but I have something to work on to let me keep on practising as the adage says _**"practice makes perfect.**_
