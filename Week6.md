## Week 6: **Python_Koans**

### What is **_Python_Koans_**

We have learned from Week 3 that **_Python_** is a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.  So what is Python_koans?  It's not another programming language but instead an interactive tutorial that consists of different puzzles and exercises that are created intended to reinforce the learning acquired in the programming language construct.  You need to pass each tests to move on to the next level.

#### Learning:

Art and logic can be combined together to create something new and relevant however; to be able to write programing codes, you need to understand what you want to achieve. Foresee the outcome you are expecting. It is only then that you will be able to understand the logic behind what you're doing.  The same in the pytho_koans process, one must understand not merely the function of the data types but also imagine the outcome that the creator wants so you can discover the logic on how each language is constructed.

The test of patience and the road to perseverance.  It's my initiative to dip in the water thinking that I will be taught the steps on how to manoeuvre the water but to my dismay, it wasn't.  I feel like I'm on my own yet I am surviving. I don't know how deep the water is, all I know is that I can still breathe, I am alive, and am ready to explore more.  Should I opt for the traditional way of learning to swim which may take years or enjoy the unconventional and still be skilful? 
After reflecting, I appreciated the test-driven development we're doing with the Python_koans.  It hones my observation skills and lets me use my creativity logically.  The course may be over but I have something to work on to let me keep on practising as the adage says _**"practice makes perfect.**_
