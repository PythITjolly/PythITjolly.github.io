#### Python Fundamentals Activity
The objective of this task is to practice coding basic Python language syntax and to apply the syntax rules to employ good coding habits for the following fundamentals:
* Variables
* User inputs
* Arithmetic operations
* Logical operations
* If.else
* Loops
<br>

**Activity 1**
_Calculate a dog's age in dog years._

**Note:** For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years.  After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
<br>

**Your program should look as follows:**
<br>

      Input a dog's age in human years: 15
      The dog's age in dog years is  73

_If the **exit()** syntax is removed, the prompt to exit will not appear._

**Activity 2**
_Convert a month name to a number of days._

**Your program should look as follows:**
<br>

      Input the name of the month: February
